    "In this excerise I had used Python module PIL which can be used to deal with different types of images ( editing, creating and drawing). I am using one of its function which is to draw polygon. I am using draw.polygon() method to draw the triangles. Then I am using fill function to fill those triangles with color( blue). I had also specified 400x400 area for the image and fixed the background color to black.  "
